# wk3-project

Project approach:

-sort out the functional aspects and js code first then worry about styling after

What I found difficult:

1. Cookie Counter & Cookies Per Second display - initial setting up using setinterval was easy enough, but then making sure it updated right with purchases etc was the more complicated part that took a while to get right.
2. GetItem & SetItem - again intial set up using the demos and moodle was fine, but then I ran into a couple of issues which took time to figure out:
   The data came back as a string so had to figure how to make that a number, then i ran the function to update cookie display within load game function
   When I ran the code on my laptop away from my PC the CPS was 0 which i realised was because there was no saved data, so added if statement with variable to deal with that.

Things I found cool:

1. Fetch was pretty straightforward after the second demo with Sam so managed to get mines all set up at the same time whilst following the demo
2. Enjoyed doing the CSS at the end when the harder aspects were out the way.
3. Managed to use the marquee tag!
